## 🧩 About the Project

This project is a *living portfolio* demonstrating how I merge **cloud engineering**, **documentation strategy**, and **technical storytelling**.

Through **Cloud Dani**, I’m documenting my growth as a technologist and storyteller — blending narrative clarity with hands-on cloud infrastructure and innovation.

---

### Background 
[CloudDani](https://www.clouddani.com) began as my implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), which is a project designed to demonstrate real-world cloud skills using either AWS, Azure or GCP. What started as a serverless résumé has grown into a living portfolio and creative lab where I explore technical writing, developer experience, and technical storytelling.

## What's in the repo? 

- 🧾 AWS-powered architecture: S3 for static hosting, CloudFront for CDN, Route 53 for DNS, API Gateway + Lambda for dynamic functions, and DynamoDB for visitor tracking.

- ⚙️ CI/CD automation: Infrastructure-as-Code using GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment workflows.

- 🤖 Upcoming: Cloud Dani Concierge — an AI-powered interactive résumé (RAG system built with OpenAI GPT-4o and Pinecone) that allows visitors to explore my work through conversation.

- 🧠 Portfolio extensions: developer experience experiments, analytics, and dynamic storytelling tools.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
